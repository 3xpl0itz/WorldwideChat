WorldwideChat is a plugin for Bukkit, Spigot, and PaperMC 1.16+.
It allows you to translate Minecraft chat live using the IBM Watson API and eventually more as it gets updated.
Some of its notable features include:
- Live translation globally, for other players, or just you.
- A cache that stores the most used phrases by players on your server, so that you don't have to ping the API constantly.
- Persistent translation options per player across server reboots and reloads.

And much more to come! 

## Installation
Download WorldwideChat from the Releases tab, or from its [SpigotMC](google.com) page.

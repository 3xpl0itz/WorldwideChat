# WorldwideChat
![](https://github.com/3xpl0itz/WorldwideChat/blob/main/resources/Banner.png)
WorldwideChat is a plugin for Bukkit, Spigot, and PaperMC 1.14+.
It allows you to translate Minecraft live using either the IBM Watson or Google Translate API (and eventually more as it gets updated).
Some of its notable features include:
- Live translation globally, for other players or just you.
- Translate chat, signs, and written books
- A cache that stores the most used phrases by players on your server, so that you don't have to ping the API constantly.
- Persistent translation options saved per player across server reboots and reloads.
- Stat tracker for all of your active translators

And much more to come!
